• Added age keypair generation to init ls and created integration tests for restore planning.

  What changed

  - init ls now creates an age keypair under /srv/btrfs-backups/dev/keys if missing in crates/dev-backup-
    cli/src/main.rs.
  - Added restore plan integration tests in crates/dev-backup-cli/tests/restore_plan.rs covering full
    chain and parent‑present optimization.
  - Added tempfile dev dependency for tests in crates/dev-backup-cli/Cargo.toml.
  - Updated docs/config.example.toml with [remote] defaults.
  - Refreshed AGENTS.md notes/testing guidance and next steps.

  Files touched

  - crates/dev-backup-cli/src/main.rs
  - crates/dev-backup-cli/Cargo.toml
  - crates/dev-backup-cli/tests/restore_plan.rs
  - docs/config.example.toml
  - AGENTS.md

  Tests not run (would need cargo to fetch crates).

  Next steps (optional):

  1. Run cargo test to validate the new integration tests.
  2. Add an ancestry check before btrfs send -p to avoid parent mismatch failures.
